computational graphs !</h3>\n        <p>ML GuI provides an online web application based utility for desigining Machine Learning Models for generic users without nedding to have indepth knowledge of coding required.</p>  \n        <p>Built as a wrapper around <a href=\"#\">ChemML</a> and a separate visualisation module - the app just needs a user to define the graphs. Rest is taken care dynamically. </p>\n        <p>Steps to define a graph : \n          <ol>\n            <li>\n              Go to Dashboard\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Load a pre saved template or if starting from scratch design your own - Right Click on canvas to add node and follow prompt to add node properties\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              To save as templates for further use, the current graph must be saved by root user. It is then available to all users for loading as template.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              After Defining a graph and setting up all node properties click on red button to run graph. Multiple Graphs can be run asynchronously in the background. \n               \n            </li>\n          </ol>\n        </p>  \n      </b-col><!--/.col-->\n    </b-row>\n    <b-row>\n      <b-col

More stable for singular matrices than   'cholesky'.  - 'cholesky' uses the standard scipy.linalg.solve function to   obtain a closed-form solution.  - 'sparse_cg' uses a conjugate gradient solver. As an iterative algorithm, this solver is   more appropriate than 'cholesky' for large-scale data   (possibility to set `tol` and `max_iter`).  - 'lsqr' uses a dedicated regularized least-squares routine. It is the fastest and uses an iterative   procedure.  - 'sag' uses a Stochastic Average Gradient descent, and 'saga' uses   its improved, unbiased version named SAGA. Both methods also use an   iterative procedure, and are often faster than other solvers when   both n_samples and n_features are large. Note that 'sag' and   'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with   approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with a   scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.\",\n          is_optional: false,\n          options: [\n            'auto',\n            'svd',\n            'cholesky',\n            'lsqr',\n            'sparse_cg',\n            'sag',\n            'saga'\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      node_functions: [\n        {\n          name: '__init__',\n          outputs: [],\n          docstring: 'None',\n          inputs: []\n        },\n        {\n          name: '_decision_function',\n          outputs: [],\n          docstring: 'None',\n          inputs: []\n        },\n        {\n          name: '_get_param_names',\n          outputs: [],\n          docstring: 'Get parameter names for the estimator',\n          inputs: []\n        },\n        {\n          name: '_preprocess_data',\n          outputs: [],\n          docstring:\n            '\\n    Centers data to have mean zero along axis 0.
