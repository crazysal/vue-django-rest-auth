More stable for singular matrices than   'cholesky'.  - 'cholesky' uses the standard scipy.linalg.solve function to   obtain a closed-form solution.  - 'sparse_cg' uses a conjugate gradient solver. As an iterative algorithm, this solver is   more appropriate than 'cholesky' for large-scale data   (possibility to set `tol` and `max_iter`).  - 'lsqr' uses a dedicated regularized least-squares routine. It is the fastest and uses an iterative   procedure.  - 'sag' uses a Stochastic Average Gradient descent, and 'saga' uses   its improved, unbiased version named SAGA. Both methods also use an   iterative procedure, and are often faster than other solvers when   both n_samples and n_features are large. Note that 'sag' and   'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with   approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with a   scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.\",\n          is_optional: false,\n          options: [\n            'auto',\n            'svd',\n            'cholesky',\n            'lsqr',\n            'sparse_cg',\n            'sag',\n            'saga'\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      node_functions: [\n        {\n          name: '__init__',\n          outputs: [],\n          docstring: 'None',\n          inputs: []\n        },\n        {\n          name: '_decision_function',\n          outputs: [],\n          docstring: 'None',\n          inputs: []\n        },\n        {\n          name: '_get_param_names',\n          outputs: [],\n          docstring: 'Get parameter names for the estimator',\n          inputs: []\n        },\n        {\n          name: '_preprocess_data',\n          outputs: [],\n          docstring:\n            '\\n    Centers data to have mean zero along axis 0.
